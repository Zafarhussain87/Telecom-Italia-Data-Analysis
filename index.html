<h1>Telecom Italia Data Analysis</h1>
<p>At the beginning of 2014, Telecom Italia launched the first edition of the Big Data Challenge, a contest designed to stimulate the creation and development of innovative technological ideas in the Big Data field. I used the data of two provinces Milano and Trento to analyse telecommunication activities, pattern, usage during the day and night. For the very provinces, i analysed the weather data and tried to find out the correlation between different weather conditions (clear, rainy, snow) and communication pattern.
</p>
<h2> Data </h2>
<p> The data was divided into two two parts, Milano and Trento. The data files include weather conditions in November and December 2013. 
Calls data to and from both provinces Milano and Trento. Internet activity of both provinces for the given two months. Data of social media content, i.e. languages which are being used on twitter, number of tweets from each geographical grid etc.
</p>

<h2> Tools </h2>
<p> I divided the tasks and data into two parts: Milano and Trento. The tool i used for this project is GraphLab. 
GraphLab is a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++. I used it with python, the idea was to study parallel machine learning computation in python.
