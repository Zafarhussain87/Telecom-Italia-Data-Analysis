# Telecom-Italia-Data-Analysis
At the beginning of 2014, Telecom Italia launched the first edition of the Big Data Challenge, a contest designed to stimulate the creation and development of innovative technological ideas in the Big Data field. I used the data of two provinces Milano and Trento to analyse telecommunication activities, pattern, usage during the day and night. For the very provinces, i analysed the weather data and tried to find out the correlation between different weather conditions (clear, rainy, snow) and communication pattern.
